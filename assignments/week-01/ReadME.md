## About the game

The game is very simple. You are prompted with a collection of words and you need to give the
answer as to what connects or explains them.
Example:

1. Amboseli
2. Maasai Mara
3. Serengetti
4. Tsavo

Answer - National Parks

For each wrong answer you give, the weighted score reduces i.e getting right on first try earns you 1.0 =100%
and getting it right on the fourth try earns you 0.25 = 25%

Technical challenge:
How do we calculate the percentage of correctness when someone gives a synonym but not the correct answer.
Will we use an array to store the correct answers or near correct answers and map them to some weights?
